# Password manager
Used Python's tkinter GUI to create a password manager that generates passwords and stores them in a separate file.
Users are to type in the website that they want to store their login details for, followed by their email/ user-id followed by their password. In the event that they have not created a password, users can click on the generate button to generate a highly secure password at random.
